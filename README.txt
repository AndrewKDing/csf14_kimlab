Andradi has more animals that received BLZ. The list that Dr. Kim pulled only has six animals, three high and three low. I will pull all of the animals that Andradi gave me, in addition to to Dr. Kim. That means, pulling all the flow files with data from CFR01 and CFR02 project codes

The extra animals were depleted for a long time, like 10 months.
Dr. Kim's animals were depleted for 1 month prior to necropsy. So let's focus on those ones.

After I analyze Dr Kim's animals, I'll ask him what he thinks about the others

Actually, the extra animals also received 1 month. I can probably use some of these for controls. But I don't have information on the dose, ART regiment, and BLZ regimen. Let's just note them down for now.

I added brdu dates for cohorts 1 and 2

Most often, BrdU timepoint for sac is taken a few days before, not at the day of sac

I need the calendars for CFR01
